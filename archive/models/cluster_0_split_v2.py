Cluster 0 Split Implementation v2 - Refined based on analysis

Key findings:
- 0d_high_receipt improved by $67.70 (27 cases)
- 0e_standard improved by $73.22 (90 cases)
- Short trips (0a) had minor improvement
- Low efficiency and long trips need different handling

New strategy: Focus on patterns that actually improve performance
