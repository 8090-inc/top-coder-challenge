# Workflow State - Legacy Reimbursement System

## Current Status
**Phase**: PLANNING
**State**: NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL

## Plan
### Phase 1: Data Analysis & Discovery
1. Load and explore public_cases.json (1,000 examples)
2. Analyze PRD.md and INTERVIEWS.md for business context
3. Perform statistical analysis on input/output relationships
4. Identify patterns, correlations, and potential formula components
5. Create visualizations to understand data distribution

### Phase 2: Hypothesis Formation & Testing
1. Form hypotheses about calculation logic based on patterns
2. Test each hypothesis against subsets of historical data
3. Validate accuracy of each potential formula component
4. Refine hypotheses based on test results

### Phase 3: Implementation & Validation
1. Implement discovered formula in Python
2. Create comprehensive test suite using historical data
3. Optimize for performance requirements (<5 seconds)
4. Validate against eval.sh continuously
5. Achieve >95% exact matches before submission

### Phase 4: Final Submission
1. Create final run.sh implementation
2. Generate results using generate_results.sh
3. Submit to repository with required access
